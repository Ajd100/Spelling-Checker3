Wearable technology including smartwatches and Google Glass will become an item that everyone will own When smartphones were released they were cool but nobody saw the point to owning one The same thing is happening with smartwatches In the years since they were introduced multiple companies have come out with various styles of watches; including small fitness trackers to full devices that strap to an individualï¿½s arm Wearable technology is built for different types of people with different intentions for the device Some people deem smartwatches useless; whereas people that have them say they are very useful When would a smartwatch ever be considered useful It really depends on the user in most cases but most smartwatches have one common feature Smartwatches pull notifications from a smartphone and allow you to read it on your wrist When you receive a notification you have the decision to answer the notification or dismiss it until later There could be many distractions on a smartphone but with the watch you never would have to access them This is caused by one disruption on the watch which will usually be a small vibration Some watches even allow you to answer the notification straight from the watch without using the phone According to Ewan Spence the smartwatch has impacted his life by allowing him to remove all distractions that are not important to him Even though Ewan believes the smartwatch is useful other people definitely do not They create distractions for the user and everyone around them Some watches also create the where's my charger problem due to alpha stages of software Android Wear and Watch iOS Google has already addressed these issues and have updated their software so that the watches could last a full day What about those fit watches that show the wearer all types of fitness statistics They are usually skinny bands that snap onto the wrist which usually include optical heart rate sensors and pedometers The heart rate sensors sense heart rate and calculate calorie burn whereas the pedometers calculate how many steps you walk in a day How are these useful to anyone Some people would like to know how many calories they have burned in a day to eat accordingly Others would like to know how many steps they walked to motivate themselves to become more fit Wearable technology is shown to improve employee productivity and their overall happiness This is caused by the data gathered by the multitude of sensors inside the device Because of this the wearable device will become common in the workplace environment  has conducted a study to see how the productivity of wearing wearables changes the study leader discovered that the productivity of workers increased by 8 5 whereas the satisfaction levels increased by 3 5 the British grocery chain named has already introduced wearable technology in their workplace These armbands have sensors that track merchandise that employees are stocking all around the stores Instead of having to carry a clipboard and mark what they have done the watch does it for them Another sensor in this device monitors fatigue and gives the employer an approximate time of completion This is very useful for the employer so that he she could plan accordingly for efficiency of work One problem does surface with this type of tracking though privacy Employers will know everything the employee has done including breathing; this is a breach of privacy But nobody needs to be worried about personal information being channeled to an employer Third party providers can protect private data while sending the basic information to management Some of the workplaces that have already taken advantage of wearable technology are law enforcement healthcare and airports The New York Police Department had a trial run with Google Glass which helped out with identifying regions with different crime rate In healthcare the camera is used to increase precision and accuracy of all types of treatment At the airports the technology could be used to speed up the check-in process and run quick background checks There are security reasons with Google Glass though Most people wouldn't know if the camera is turned on or off Google is reinventing the Glass so that it is more secure for the users and people around them This will initially push Google Glass to more employers for use thus bringing technological glasses to the workforce In reality will wearable technology ever catch on in the future Yes this type of technology will catch on due to the benefits of having it Smartwatches pull notifications from a smartphone and allow the user to answer or dismiss all on their wrist Fitness bracelets give users all types of statistics including heart rate calorie burn and steps taken Special bands can help employers keep track of their workers and allow them to work more efficiently without fatiguing quickly Technological glasses such as Google Glass will improve careers with critical thinking thanks to its imaging and quick access features Given the statistics from the studies conducted wearable technology will exponentially and inevitably become universal
